# HackTheBreak2023 # SKILL_ISSUE
Project by Felix Wei, Kalvin Leung, Marvin Sio

SKILL ISSUE is a website that aggregates technical courses and ceriticates from across the tech field.
Users can browse for courses and filter by tags to find the one they think will help them keep their skills up to date.

On this build, the website runs through the landing page index.html (the best way is via live server on microsoft visual code studio).
Our plans were to host the website through infinityfree but the server was not ready in time by submission deadline. 

Thanks.
